[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   [music]
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300]   Could you spare a second?
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.540]   So will you please listen
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.900]   to the story of Cara Thiya?
[00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.240]   She called for freedom
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.540]   She a four-legend
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.140]   Dreaming of splendid adventure
[00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.640]   Will the prophecy manifest?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.640]   Will I be the maiden who was blessed?
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.240]   And I, down the glory path
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.840]   Bring all the red brightness back
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.240]   I've heard all the enemies in sight
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.940]   There is no turning back this time
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.140]   Will I realize?
[00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440]   Will I realize?
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.640]   Will the world be placed on my head?
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.240]   One day we shall cheer and dance
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   We can draw a forever light
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:30.240]   [music]
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.640]   I've seen nothing but a vicious light
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.940]   Here comes the growling, dark, tight
[00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.640]   The more pain she feels, the clearer she sees
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.240]   Halo's of divine or fading
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.540]   I can't hear a bell of faith sound
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.440]   It's high time to turn it around
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.440]   I'll carry on a glorious journey
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.040]   With the blessed and wished by my side
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.240]   Won't accept the faith that is set
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.940]   There is no turning back this time
[00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.340]   This will feel like it will realize
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.640]   Truth in my heart never dies
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.140]   Oh, there's no all the veils of lies
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.340]   With the silver sword in my eyes
[00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.540]   Oh, and I, mine falls in me
[00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.940]   Grab me and lies, my goal shins miss
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.440]   I'm still that girl, carrying the hopes
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.440]   I'll break the shackles, free the souls
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.340]   Trapped in those dark walls
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.340]   [music]
[00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.940]   Nothing can stop me walking down this path
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.940]   Bringing on the rim less seems back
[00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.840]   Won't accept the faith that is set
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.640]   There is no turning back this time
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.140]   It will be true, it will be true
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.640]   Be a closure for this myth or one
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.040]   Maybe she'll cheer and dance
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.740]   Making joy forever love
[00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.740]   [music]
