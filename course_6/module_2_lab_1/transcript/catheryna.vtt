2
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.300
   Could you spare a second?

3
00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.540
   So will you please listen

4
00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.900
   to the story of Cara Thiya?

5
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.240
   She called for freedom

6
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.540
   She a four-legend

7
00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.140
   Dreaming of splendid adventure

8
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.640
   Will the prophecy manifest?

9
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.640
   Will I be the maiden who was blessed?

10
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.240
   And I, down the glory path

11
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.840
   Bring all the red brightness back

12
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.240
   I've heard all the enemies in sight

13
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.940
   There is no turning back this time

14
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.140
   Will I realize?

15
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.440
   Will I realize?

16
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.640
   Will the world be placed on my head?

17
00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.240
   One day we shall cheer and dance

18
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.240
   We can draw a forever light

19
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:30.240
   [music]

20
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.640
   I've seen nothing but a vicious light

21
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.940
   Here comes the growling, dark, tight

22
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.640
   The more pain she feels, the clearer she sees

23
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.240
   Halo's of divine or fading

24
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.540
   I can't hear a bell of faith sound

25
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.440
   It's high time to turn it around

26
00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.440
   I'll carry on a glorious journey

27
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.040
   With the blessed and wished by my side

28
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.240
   Won't accept the faith that is set

29
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.940
   There is no turning back this time

30
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.340
   This will feel like it will realize

31
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.640
   Truth in my heart never dies

32
00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.140
   Oh, there's no all the veils of lies

33
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.340
   With the silver sword in my eyes

34
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.540
   Oh, and I, mine falls in me

35
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.940
   Grab me and lies, my goal shins miss

36
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.440
   I'm still that girl, carrying the hopes

37
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.440
   I'll break the shackles, free the souls

38
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.340
   Trapped in those dark walls

39
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.340
   [music]

40
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.940
   Nothing can stop me walking down this path

41
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.940
   Bringing on the rim less seems back

42
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.840
   Won't accept the faith that is set

43
00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.640
   There is no turning back this time

44
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.140
   It will be true, it will be true

45
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.640
   Be a closure for this myth or one

46
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.040
   Maybe she'll cheer and dance

47
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.740
   Making joy forever love
