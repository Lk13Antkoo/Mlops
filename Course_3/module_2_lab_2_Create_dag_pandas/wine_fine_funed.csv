4,1000 Stories Bourbon Barrel Aged Zinfandel 2014,,California,Red Wine,90.0,"Batch #004 is the first release of the 2014 vintage and once againMendocino Zinfandel plays a big role in the blend with classic oldvineyards such as Sargentini and Rucker vineyards. Head trained and dry farmed, these vineyards give nice raspberry fruits. Dry Creek Valley Zinfandel also makes a big impact on the blend in Batch #004. Dry Creek is a classic and well known source for great Zinfandel and has added a new dimension to the 1000 Stories blend. Black fruits with distinct notes of black pepper and even a bit of clove spice add complexity to the blend. Also new to this batch is the addition of Lodi Zinfandel, with its iconic bold flavors and big character. Rounding out the blend are some Zinfandels from Colusa County, Syrah from Paso Robles and Petite sirah from Mendocino. A portion of the wine is aged in French and American oak for 6 months and then aged further in bourbon barrels. Weâ€™ve selected new and used bourbon barrels for these small batches of Zinfandel, which impart characteristics specific to these barrels: charred vanilla, dried herbs and a hint of caramel."
